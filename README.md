# Timetable_management-_project
The problem is to design and implement an algorithm to create a semester course time table by assigning time-slots and rooms to a given set of courses to be run that semester under given constraints
Although most of the college administrative work has been computerized, the lecture- timetable scheduling is still mostly done manually due to its technical difficulties. The manual scheduling of lecture-timetable requires considerable time and efforts. The lecture-timetable scheduling is a constraint satisfaction problem in which we find an optimal solution that satisfies the given set of constraints.
